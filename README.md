# MonoWing-3D-V1
Pic and STL files for MonoWing 3D V1
Pic file can be use for lasercutting the foam or can be scaled for manual use. Wingtip to wingtip width is 490mm.
All STL files have been printed and tested with Cura standard settings, with 0.2mm layer height and 0.4mm nozzle width with 1.75mm STL.
Files are pretty much the original versions except some updates done due to building issues for the original prototype.

# MonoWing-3D-V2
This is the latest version
About 50g lighter than V1 with slightly larger wing area.
Easier to launch and very stable platform.
Canopy is not included. I built a simple canopy from 3mm depron to keep it lighter.
